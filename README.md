Inital machine learning projects


In this repo, you can see three machine learning projects I used to investigate: Multiple_Linear_Regression, Multiple_Linear_Regression and SVM. The projects are written out in investigation style to provide oppertunity for me or a reader to reflect on the code and what each step does.
